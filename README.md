<p>We introduce a deep learning framework named <b>Shennong</b> for <i>in silico</i> screening of anticancer drugs for targeting each of the landscape cell clusters. Utilizing Shennong, we could predict individual cell responses to pharmacologic compounds, evaluate drug candidates’ tissue damaging effects, and investigate their corresponding action mechanisms. Prioritized compounds in Shennong’s prediction results include FDA-approved drugs currently undergoing clinical trials for new indications, as well as drug candidates reporting anti-tumor activity. Furthermore, the tissue damaging effect prediction aligns with documented injuries and terminated discovery events. This robust and explainable framework has the potential to accelerate the drug discovery process and enhance the accuracy and efficiency of drug screening.</p>

The training and prediction results could be obtained and queried on our website (<a src="http://bis.zju.edu.cn/shennong/index.html">http://bis.zju.edu.cn/shennong/index.html</a>).
